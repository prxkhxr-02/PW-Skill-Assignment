    "### Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Organize your data: Make sure you have a dataset that includes the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores. Let's denote these two variables as X (study time) and Y (exam scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the means: Find the mean (average) of both X and Y. You can denote these as X̄ and Ȳ.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the standard deviations: Find the standard deviation of X (denoted as σX) and the standard deviation of Y (denoted as σY).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the covariance: Compute the covariance between X and Y, which is denoted as Cov(X, Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (r): Use the formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[r = \\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{σX * σY}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Interpret the result:\n",
    "   - If r is close to +1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, final exam scores tend to increase as well.\n",
    "   - If r is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, final exam scores tend to decrease.\n",
    "   - If r is close to 0, it indicates a weak or no linear relationship. In other words, there is little to no correlation between study time and exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. A value of 0 indicates no linear correlation, while values closer to -1 or +1 indicate stronger linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that correlation does not imply causation. Even if you find a correlation between study time and exam scores, it does not necessarily mean that studying more directly causes higher exam scores. Other factors may be at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it's important to note that the Pearson correlation coefficient measures only linear relationships. If the relationship between study time and exam scores is nonlinear, the correlation coefficient may not accurately capture the association between the two variables."

    "### Q2. Spearman's rank correlation is a measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10.

    "\n",
    "Ans -> Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, denoted as ρ (rho), is used to measure the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two variables. Monotonic relationships are those where the variables tend to move in the same direction (either both increasing or both decreasing), but not necessarily at a constant rate as in linear relationships. \n",
