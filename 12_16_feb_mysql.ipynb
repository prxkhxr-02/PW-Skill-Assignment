    "### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans -> A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and querying of information. Databases are widely used in various applications and systems to store and handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their data models, query languages, and overall design philosophies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL Databases:\n",
    "   SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational data model. They store data in tables, which consist of rows and columns. The relationships between tables are defined using keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys. SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   SQL databases provide several advantages:\n",
    "   - Strong data consistency and integrity.\n",
    "   - Well-defined schemas that enforce data consistency.\n",
    "   - ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity and transaction support.\n",
    "   - Suitable for complex queries and data relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle Database, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "   NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases use various data models and structures other than the traditional relational model. They are designed to handle large volumes of rapidly changing, unstructured, or semi-structured data. NoSQL databases offer flexibility, scalability, and high performance for certain use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "   NoSQL databases can be categorized into different types:\n",
    "   - Document databases: Store and retrieve semi-structured data in documents, typically in JSON or XML formats. Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.\n",
    "   - Key-value stores: Use a simple key-value data model for rapid data retrieval. Examples include Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "   - Columnar databases: Organize data into columns instead of rows for efficient data compression and analytic queries. Examples include Apache Cassandra and Apache HBase.\n",
    "   - Graph databases: Store and retrieve data based on graph structures, with nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.\n",
    "\n",
    "   NoSQL databases provide the following advantages:\n",
    "   - Flexible schema that allows for agile development and schema evolution.\n",
    "   - Horizontal scalability and distributed architecture to handle large-scale data.\n",
    "   - High performance for certain types of queries, especially those involving large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both SQL and NoSQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of an application or system. Some applications may even use a combination of both types, known as polyglot persistence, to leverage the benefits of each database for different aspects of the data storage and retrieval needs. "

    "### Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations and examples of commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "   The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Creating a table named \"Employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary in a hypothetical company's database.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP:\n",
    "   The DROP statement is used to remove database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Dropping the previously created \"Employees\" table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "   The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It can be used to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Adding a new column named \"Department\" to the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "   ADD Department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "   The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table, but it keeps the table structure intact. It is faster than deleting all rows individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Truncating the data from the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that DDL statements are auto-committed in most database systems, meaning that the changes made by these statements are immediately permanent and cannot be rolled back. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using DDL statements, as they have a direct impact on the database structure and data."

    "### Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans -> DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate data within a database. DML statements are responsible for inserting, updating, and deleting data in database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations and examples of commonly used DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT:\n",
    "   The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Inserting a new employee record into the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary)\n",
    "   VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE:\n",
    "   The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Updating the salary of an employee with EmployeeID 1 in the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   UPDATE Employees\n",
    "   SET Salary = 55000\n",
    "   WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE:\n",
    "   The DELETE statement is used to remove specific rows of data from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Deleting an employee record with EmployeeID 1 from the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "   WHERE EmployeeID = 1;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that DML statements can affect one or multiple rows in a table based on the conditions specified in the WHERE clause. These statements allow you to manipulate the data stored in the database and perform operations such as adding new records, updating existing ones, or removing unwanted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using DML statements, it's essential to be cautious, as they directly affect the data within the tables. It's advisable to use proper filtering conditions in the WHERE clause to ensure that only the desired rows are affected and to take appropriate backups or use transaction mechanisms if necessary to ensure data integrity."

    "### Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "Ans -> DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to retrieve data from a database. DQL statements are primarily focused on querying and retrieving data from tables based on specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT. It allows you to retrieve data from one or more tables and specify the criteria for selecting specific rows or columns. Here's an explanation and an example of the SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT:\n",
    "The SELECT statement is used to query data from one or more tables. It allows you to retrieve specific columns, apply filtering conditions, sort the result set, perform calculations, and join multiple tables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Retrieving the names and salaries of all employees from the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name, Salary\n",
    "FROM Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query will return a result set containing the \"Name\" and \"Salary\" columns for all rows in the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further refine the SELECT statement by applying filtering conditions using the WHERE clause. For example, you can retrieve only the employees with a salary greater than a specific value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name, Salary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Salary > 50000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can use the SELECT statement to perform calculations or aggregations on the retrieved data. For instance, you can calculate the total salary of all employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary\n",
    "FROM Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above query will return the sum of all salaries as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT statement is highly versatile and allows for complex queries involving multiple tables, joins, subqueries, and various functions to retrieve and manipulate data according to specific requirements. It is a fundamental tool for data retrieval and analysis in SQL databases."

    "### Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a combination of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of data within the table. Here are some key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two rows can have the same value for the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-nullability: The primary key column(s) cannot contain null values. It must have a value for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unchangeability: The values of the primary key should remain constant once they are assigned to a row. Changing the primary key value would break referential integrity and data relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Single value or combination: A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns, known as a composite primary key. Composite primary keys are useful when a single column cannot uniquely identify each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary keys are used to enforce data integrity and create relationships between tables. They provide a unique identifier for each row, which helps in indexing, data retrieval, and maintaining consistency within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that establishes a link or relationship between that table and another table. It refers to the primary key column(s) of another table and represents a connection between the two tables. Key points about foreign keys are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relationship: A foreign key represents a relationship between tables, where it refers to the primary key of another table, known as the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Referential Integrity: Foreign keys maintain referential integrity by ensuring that values in the foreign key column(s) of one table match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Consistency: Foreign keys help enforce data consistency by preventing the insertion of invalid or nonexistent data into the referencing table. The foreign key constraint ensures that any value in the foreign key column must exist in the referenced table's primary key column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign keys are commonly used to establish relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, between tables. They enable data integrity, provide structural integrity, and enforce the rules defined by the relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that primary keys and foreign keys work together to create and maintain relationships between tables, ensuring data consistency and integrity within the database."

    "### Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.\n",
    "To connect MySQL to Python, you can use the `mysql-connector-python` library. First, you need to install the library using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install mysql-connector-python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to connect to MySQL and perform database operations using the cursor and execute methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MySQL\n",
    "connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"your_username\",\n",
    "    password=\"your_password\",\n",
    "    database=\"your_database\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor object to interact with the database\n",
    "cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute a SQL query\n",
    "query = \"SELECT * FROM employees\"\n",
    "cursor.execute(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch the result set\n",
    "result_set = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process the fetched data\n",
    "for row in result_set:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The `mysql.connector` module is imported to provide the necessary functions for connecting to and interacting with MySQL.\n",
    "- `mysql.connector.connect()` is used to establish a connection to the MySQL server by providing the host, username, password, and database name.\n",
    "- `cursor()` method creates a cursor object, which allows you to execute SQL statements and retrieve results.\n",
    "- `execute()` method is used to execute an SQL query. You pass the SQL query as a string parameter to this method.\n",
    "- `fetchall()` method retrieves all rows of the result set from the last executed query.\n",
    "- The fetched data is processed using a loop (in this case, printed to the console).\n",
    "- Finally, the `close()` method is called on both the cursor and the connection objects to release the resources and close the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cursor` object provides methods to execute SQL statements, fetch results, iterate over result sets, and perform various database operations. The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries and statements. It takes the SQL statement as a parameter and executes it against the connected MySQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this code snippet demonstrates how to establish a connection to MySQL, create a cursor object, execute SQL queries, retrieve results, and close the connection properly."

    "### Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "Ans -> In a standard SQL query, the clauses are generally executed in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FROM: The FROM clause specifies the tables or views from which the data will be retrieved. It identifies the data source for the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. WHERE: The WHERE clause filters the rows from the specified tables based on the given conditions. It allows you to specify the criteria for selecting specific rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is used to group the rows based on one or more columns. It is often used in combination with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. HAVING: The HAVING clause is used to filter the grouped rows based on conditions. It operates similarly to the WHERE clause but works on the grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. SELECT: The SELECT clause specifies the columns that will be retrieved from the tables. It determines the data elements that will be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DISTINCT: The DISTINCT keyword is used to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set. It ensures that each row in the result set is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on specified columns. It allows you to define the sorting order as ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. LIMIT/OFFSET: The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used for pagination or limiting the number of rows returned by the query. LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows, and OFFSET specifies the number of rows to skip.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query. The clauses you use and the order in which you use them depend on the specific requirements of your query and the desired result set.\n"
