    "### Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "Ans -> There are several methods and techniques used for web scraping, ranging from simple approaches to more advanced and complex ones. Here are some of the common methods used for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Manual Copy-Paste:** The simplest method involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a spreadsheet or text file. While this approach is straightforward, it's time-consuming and not suitable for large-scale scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regular Expressions:** Regular expressions (regex) can be used to search for patterns in HTML content and extract specific data. While regex can be powerful for simple tasks, they can become complex and error-prone when dealing with more complex HTML structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **HTML Parsing Libraries:** These libraries provide tools to parse HTML documents and extract specific elements and data. Popular libraries include BeautifulSoup (for Python), jsoup (for Java), and lxml (for Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **XPath:** XPath is a query language for selecting nodes from XML or HTML documents. It allows you to navigate through the document's structure and extract specific elements and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CSS Selectors:** Similar to XPath, CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements based on their class, id, attributes, or hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Headless Browsers:** Headless browsers like Puppeteer (for Node.js) and Playwright (for multiple languages) simulate a real browser environment and allow you to interact with websites just like a user would. This can be useful for scraping dynamic and JavaScript-rendered content.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **APIs:** Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that provide structured data in a machine-readable format like JSON or XML. Using APIs is a more reliable and efficient way to gather data when available.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Scraping Frameworks:** There are scraping frameworks like Scrapy (for Python) that provide a complete solution for building web scrapers. They handle tasks like making HTTP requests, parsing HTML, and managing concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Proxy Servers and Rotating User Agents:** To avoid being blocked by websites due to excessive requests, you can use proxy servers and rotate user agents to make your requests appear more natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Machine Learning and AI:** Advanced techniques involve using machine learning and AI to extract specific information from unstructured text, images, or other media types on websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice of method depends on factors like the complexity of the website's structure, the amount of data you need, ethical considerations, and your programming skills. Additionally, always ensure you are following legal and ethical guidelines when scraping websites."

    "```python\n",
    "from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make an HTTP request to the webpage\n",
    "response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Beautiful Soup object\n",
    "soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find all links on the webpage\n",
    "links = soup.find_all('a')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the links\n",
    "for link in links:\n",
    "    print(link.get('href'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Beautiful Soup is used to parse the HTML content of a webpage, find all the `<a>` (anchor) tags representing links, and then print the URLs of those links. This demonstrates how Beautiful Soup simplifies the process of extracting information from HTML documents."
