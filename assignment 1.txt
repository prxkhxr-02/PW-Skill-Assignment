Ans:1. 
1.For loop:
   - Use a for loop when you know the number of iterations beforehand or when you want to iterate over a sequence like a list, tuple, or string.
 
   Example using a for loop to iterate over a list:
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   for num in numbers:
       print(num)
   

2. While loop:
   - Use a while loop when you don't know the number of iterations beforehand or when you want to iterate until a certain condition is met.

   Example using a while loop to iterate until a condition is met
   num = 0
   while num < 5:
       print(num)
       num += 1

1.Using for loop:

sum_result = 0
product_result = 1

for i in range(1, 11):
    sum_result += i
    product_result *= i

print("Using for loop:")
print("Sum of the first 10 natural numbers:", sum_result)
print("Product of the first 10 natural numbers:", product_result)


2.Using while loop:

sum_result = 0
product_result = 1
num = 1

while num <= 10:
    sum_result += num
    product_result *= num
    num += 1

print("Using while loop:")

def calculate_electricity_bill(units):
    total_bill = 0
    
    if units <= 100:
        total_bill = units * 4.5
    elif units <= 200:
        total_bill = 100 * 4.5 + (units - 100) * 6
    elif units <= 300:
        total_bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + (units - 200) * 10
    else:
        total_bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + 100 * 10 + (units - 300) * 20
    
    return total_bill

units_consumed = int(input("Enter the units of electricity consumed in a month: "))

electricity_bill = calculate_electricity_bill(units_consumed)

print("Total electricity bill: Rs.", electricity_bill)

1.Using for loop:

cubes_divisible_by_4_or_5 = []

for num in range(1, 101):
    cube = num ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        cubes_divisible_by_4_or_5.append(num)

print("Using for loop:", cubes_divisible_by_4_or_5)


Using while loop:

cubes_divisible_by_4_or_5 = []
num = 1

while num <= 100:
    cube = num ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        cubes_divisible_by_4_or_5.append(num)
    num += 1

print("Using while loop:", cubes_divisible_by_4_or_5)
