    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans -> MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system. It falls under the category of non-relational databases. Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to store and manage unstructured, semi-structured, or highly dynamic data. Here are some key points about non-relational databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible Schema: Non-relational databases have a flexible schema, allowing for dynamic changes to the structure of data without strict pre-defined schemas. This flexibility is particularly useful in scenarios where the data is diverse, evolving, or requires frequent modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: Non-relational databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means they can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads by distributing data across multiple servers or nodes. This scalability makes them well-suited for handling big data and highly scalable applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. High Performance: NoSQL databases are optimized for performance and can deliver high-speed read and write operations. They achieve this by relaxing some of the traditional ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties maintained by SQL databases, allowing for eventual consistency and increased throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Variety of Data Models: Non-relational databases support different data models such as document-based, key-value, columnar, and graph. Each model is optimized for specific use cases and provides efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms for different types of data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unstructured or Semi-structured Data: MongoDB is suitable for scenarios where data is unstructured or has a dynamic schema. It allows for easy storage and retrieval of complex, evolving data structures like JSON documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rapid Prototyping and Agile Development: MongoDB's flexible schema makes it ideal for rapid prototyping and agile development processes. It allows developers to quickly iterate and modify the data model as requirements evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Big Data and High Volume Workloads: MongoDB's ability to scale horizontally and handle large volumes of data makes it well-suited for big data applications and high-traffic workloads that require massive scalability and fast data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Real-time Analytics and Personalization: MongoDB's document-based model and indexing capabilities enable real-time analytics and personalized data processing. It can efficiently handle data-intensive applications that require real-time insights and personalized user experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Geospatial Data and IoT Applications: MongoDB provides robust support for geospatial data and is commonly used in applications that require location-based services, geospatial indexing, and analysis. It is also well-suited for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where data arrives in a dynamic and unstructured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice between MongoDB and SQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, data structure, scalability needs, and the consistency and transactional requirements of the data. Each database type has its strengths and trade-offs, and the selection should be based on the specific use case and data characteristics."

    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans -> MongoDB is a feature-rich NoSQL database management system that offers several key features that set it apart. Here are some of the prominent features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented Model: MongoDB follows a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in flexible, self-descriptive JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). This allows for easy storage and retrieval of complex data structures, nested arrays, and key-value pairs within a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Schema: MongoDB has a dynamic schema, which means that documents within a collection can have different structures. This flexibility allows for easy and agile development, as schema modifications can be made without affecting existing data. It is particularly useful in scenarios where data evolves rapidly or has varying attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability and High Availability: MongoDB is designed for scalability and high availability. It supports horizontal scaling through sharding, which involves distributing data across multiple servers or clusters. This allows MongoDB to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads by leveraging the power of multiple machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Indexing and Querying: MongoDB provides flexible indexing capabilities to optimize query performance. It supports various types of indexes, including single-field indexes, compound indexes, geospatial indexes, and text indexes. These indexes improve query performance and enable efficient searching, sorting, and filtering of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Ad Hoc Queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, allowing you to perform complex queries using a flexible query language. Its query language includes a wide range of operators and features, making it easier to retrieve and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides a powerful Aggregation Framework, which allows for advanced data analysis and processing. It includes various pipeline stages and operators to perform complex transformations, aggregations, grouping, and data transformations on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Full-text Search: MongoDB includes built-in support for full-text search, enabling efficient text search capabilities across documents and collections. It supports text indexes, relevance scoring, and language-specific stemming to enhance search functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Replication and Fault Tolerance: MongoDB offers built-in replication and fault tolerance mechanisms. It supports replica sets, which are self-healing clusters consisting of primary and multiple secondary nodes. Replica sets ensure high availability and automatic failover in case of primary node failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Geospatial and IoT Capabilities: MongoDB provides extensive geospatial data support, allowing for geospatial indexing, querying, and analysis. It includes various geospatial operators and indexes to efficiently handle location-based data. Additionally, MongoDB is well-suited for IoT applications, as it can handle real-time streaming data and dynamic data schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Community and Ecosystem: MongoDB has a vibrant and active community, with strong community support and resources. It offers a wide range of drivers and libraries for integration with popular programming languages and frameworks, making it easier to work with MongoDB in different development environments.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans -> To connect MongoDB to Python, you can use the `pymongo` library. First, you need to install the library using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pip install pymongo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example Python code snippet that demonstrates how to connect to MongoDB, create a database, and a collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a database\n",
    "database = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a collection\n",
    "collection = database[\"mycollection\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert a document into the collection\n",
    "document = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "collection.insert_one(document)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the connection\n",
    "client.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The `pymongo` module is imported to provide the necessary functions for connecting to and interacting with MongoDB.\n",
    "- `pymongo.MongoClient()` is used to establish a connection to the MongoDB server. You need to provide the connection string, which includes the host and port of the MongoDB server.\n",
    "- `client[\"mydatabase\"]` creates a database named \"mydatabase\". You can replace \"mydatabase\" with your desired database name.\n",
    "- `database[\"mycollection\"]` creates a collection named \"mycollection\" within the \"mydatabase\" database. You can replace \"mycollection\" with your desired collection name.\n",
    "- `collection.insert_one(document)` inserts a document (a Python dictionary) into the collection. In this example, a document with a \"name\" field and an \"age\" field is inserted.\n",
    "- Finally, `client.close()` is called to close the MongoDB connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "By executing this code, you will establish a connection to MongoDB, create a database named \"mydatabase\", and a collection named \"mycollection\". You will also insert a document into the collection. Remember to replace the connection string, database name, collection name, and document data with your desired values.\n",
    "\n",

    "### * Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "The `find()` method in MongoDB is used to query the database and retrieve documents that match specific criteria. It allows you to search for documents based on one or more conditions and retrieve the matching results. Here's a brief explanation of how the `find()` method works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Specifying Filter Criteria: You can provide a filter object as an argument to the `find()` method to specify the criteria for filtering documents. The filter object uses MongoDB's query syntax to define the conditions. For example, you can specify the equality condition, range condition, or use logical operators like `$and`, `$or`, etc., to compose complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Returning Matched Documents: The `find()` method returns a cursor, which is an iterable object that provides access to the matched documents. By default, the `find()` method returns all documents that match the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modifying the Result Set: You can use various methods like `limit()`, `skip()`, `sort()`, etc., to modify the result set. These methods allow you to limit the number of documents returned, skip a certain number of documents, or sort the documents based on specific fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple code example that demonstrates how to use the `find()` method to query a MongoDB database:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans -> The `sort()` method in MongoDB is used to sort the documents in a collection based on one or more fields. It allows you to specify the field(s) to sort on and the sort order, either in ascending or descending order. Here's an explanation of how the `sort()` method works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sorting by a Single Field: You can provide a field name as an argument to the `sort()` method to specify the field by which the documents should be sorted. By default, the sorting is done in ascending order (from the lowest value to the highest value) for that field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sorting by Multiple Fields: To sort by multiple fields, you can provide an array of field names to the `sort()` method. MongoDB will sort the documents first by the first field specified, and for documents with the same value in the first field, it will sort them by the second field, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sorting in Descending Order: If you want to sort the documents in descending order (from the highest value to the lowest value), you can use the `-1` value as a prefix to the field name(s) in the `sort()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates sorting in MongoDB using the `sort()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "In MongoDB, the `delete_one()`, `delete_many()`, and `drop()` methods are used for different purposes when it comes to removing data from a collection or even dropping an entire collection. Here's an explanation of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `delete_one()` method: This method is used to delete a single document that matches a specified filter criteria. It removes the first document that satisfies the given criteria. If multiple documents match the criteria, only the first one encountered in the natural order of the collection will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"Alice\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `delete_many()` method: This method is used to delete multiple documents that match a specified filter criteria. It removes all the documents that satisfy the given criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = collection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `drop()` method: This method is used to drop an entire collection from the database. Dropping a collection permanently removes all the documents and the indexes associated with that collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "collection.drop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- `delete_one()` can be used when you want to remove a specific document from a collection based on certain conditions. For example, you may want to delete a user document with a specific ID or remove a document that has expired based on a timestamp field.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `delete_many()` is useful when you want to delete multiple documents that match certain criteria. For instance, you might want to remove all documents where the status is set to \"inactive\" or delete all documents that are older than a certain date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `drop()` is employed when you want to completely remove a collection from the database. This can be useful when you want to start fresh or no longer require the data stored in that collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to exercise caution when using these methods, especially `drop()`, as they permanently delete data from the database. Make sure to double-check your criteria before executing these operations to prevent accidental data loss."
