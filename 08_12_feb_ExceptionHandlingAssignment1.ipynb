    "### Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "Ans -> Exception are the event in the program in which the error occuor due the to file not found error , divide by Zero error etc \n",
    "while Syntax errors are the gramtical made by the developer while writing the code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation occurs, an exception object is created, and the program flow is transferred to an appropriate exception handler that can handle or respond to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions in Python can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, network errors, division by zero, and more. Python provides a mechanism to handle these exceptions through the use of try-except blocks. By handling exceptions, you can gracefully recover from errors, take alternative actions, or display appropriate error messages to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are different from exceptions. Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters invalid code that violates the language's syntax rules. These errors prevent the interpreter from parsing and executing the code. They are usually caused by typos, missing or misplaced punctuation, incorrect indentation, or using incorrect language constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cause: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when an exceptional condition arises, such as invalid input or unexpected situations. Syntax errors occur during the parsing phase before the execution of the program when the code structure violates the syntax rules of the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks. You can write code to catch specific exceptions and perform appropriate actions to handle them. Syntax errors cannot be handled through try-except blocks because they prevent the code from being parsed and executed. Syntax errors must be fixed by correcting the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Impact on program execution: Exceptions, when unhandled, can cause the program to terminate abruptly or behave unexpectedly. By handling exceptions, you can control the program flow and provide appropriate error handling. Syntax errors, on the other hand, prevent the program from running altogether until the errors are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Error messages: Exceptions provide detailed error messages that describe the cause and type of exception that occurred. These messages can help with debugging and identifying the root cause of the issue. Syntax errors, on the other hand, usually provide specific error messages that indicate the line number and nature of the syntax error, helping developers locate and fix the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are events that occur during program execution, disrupting the normal flow and requiring handling. Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors in the code structure that prevent the program from running altogether until the errors are fixed."

    "### Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans -> When the exception is not handled then the error occurs and program exection stop \n",
    "for example \n",
    "if we have a code like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Enter number:\")) #ask user to input integer value\n",
    "    y=10/x   #divide by zero will occur if entered non-integer values   \n",

    "        else:\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        If there are any other errors in try block, it won’t be caught because no corresponding\n",
    "        `except` clause exists for that particular type of Error. In such cases Python interpreter prints out\n",
    "        stack trace which shows where exactly did our program fail along with its line numbers etc., so that\n",
    "        programmer knows what went wrong at each step.<|im_sep|>\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        When an exception is not handled in Python, it results in the program terminating abruptly and an error message being displayed. This behavior is known as an unhandled exception or an uncaught exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example where an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    result = a / b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a function `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and divides them. The `num2` variable is set to 0, which will cause a `ZeroDivisionError` when attempting to divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the code is executed, the line `result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)` will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` exception since dividing by zero is mathematically invalid. Since there is no try-except block to handle this exception, the exception propagates up the call stack until it reaches the top level of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the program terminates with an error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 8, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide_numbers\n",
    "    result = a / b\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The traceback shows the sequence of function calls that led to the exception, with the specific error message indicating the type of exception (`ZeroDivisionError`) and the cause of the error (`division by zero`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, without proper exception handling, the program execution is halted, and the error message provides information about the unhandled exception. It's essential to handle exceptions appropriately in order to prevent unexpected termination and to provide graceful error handling or recovery mechanisms within the program."

    "### **Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `try-except` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions. The `try` block encloses the code that might raise an exception, and the `except` block specifies the code to be executed if a specific exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the use of `try-except` statements to catch and handle an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = a / b\n",
    "        print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",

    "num2 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide_numbers` function attempts to divide `a` by `b` and prints the result. However, we have a `try-except` block to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` exception that may occur if the divisor `b` is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the code is executed, the `divide_numbers(num1, num2)` call will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. However, instead of terminating the program, the exception is caught by the `except` block that specifically handles `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code within the `except` block is executed, which prints the error message \"Error: Cannot divide by zero!\". This provides a graceful way to handle the exception and display a user-friendly message instead of an unhandled exception and program termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the example will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: Cannot divide by zero!\n",

    "Q4. Explain with an example:\n",
    "try and else#\n",
    "finally\n",
    "raise \n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Let's go through each of these statements with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **try and else:**\n",
    "The `try` and `else` statements work together to handle exceptions and execute code when no exceptions occur. The code within the `try` block is executed, and if an exception is raised, it is caught and handled. If no exception occurs, the code within the `else` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 2\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the division operation inside the `try` block is successful, so no exception occurs. As a result, the code within the `else` block is executed, printing \"Result: 5\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **finally:**\n",
    "The `finally` block is used to specify code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    # Perform some file operations\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: File not found!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `try` block attempts to open a file for reading. If a `FileNotFoundError` occurs because the file does not exist, the exception is caught and handled. Regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, the `finally` block is executed, ensuring that the file is closed and resources are released.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **raise:**\n",
    "The `raise` statement is used to explicitly raise an exception. It allows you to create custom exceptions or re-raise existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def validate_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Invalid age: Age cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    age = -5\n",
    "    validate_age(age)\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(str(e))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `validate_age` function checks if the given age is negative and raises a `ValueError` if it is. In the `try` block, an age of -5 is passed to the function, triggering the `raise` statement. The `ValueError` is then caught in the `except` block, and the error message \"Invalid age: Age cannot be negative.\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `raise` statement is useful when you encounter exceptional conditions in your code and want to handle them as specific exceptions or propagate them to higher levels of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "These statements - `try`, `else`, `finally`, and `raise` - provide the necessary constructs for handling exceptions, executing cleanup operations, and explicitly raising exceptions in Python."

    "We need custom exceptions to provide more specific and meaningful error messages for exceptional situations in our code. By defining custom exception classes, we can create exception hierarchies that reflect the structure and logic of our program, making it easier to handle and differentiate between different types of errors.\n",

    "In this example, we define a custom exception hierarchy for bank account-related errors. The base class `WithdrawalError` is created as a subclass of the built-in `Exception` class. Then, we define a more specific exception `InsufficientFundsError` as a subclass of `WithdrawalError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BankAccount` class has a `withdraw` method that raises the `InsufficientFundsError` exception if the withdrawal amount exceeds the account balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the `withdraw` method is called and an `InsufficientFundsError` is raised, the exception is caught in the `except` block, and the error message \"Insufficient funds in the account.\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using custom exceptions, we provide clear and specific error messages for different exceptional situations. This allows us to handle different types of errors separately and provide appropriate error handling logic for each situation.\n",
